         * Notes that only exist in one clip are faded in/out using velocity
         * Where several notes of the same pitch exist, if the number of notes do not match the target clip, any extraneous notes are faded in/out using velocity.
         * Notes that exist in both clips, i.e. share pitch but not position, are interpolated over the course of the specified number of durations.
