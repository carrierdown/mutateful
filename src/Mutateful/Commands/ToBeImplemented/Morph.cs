    /* To be implemented...
     * Morphs between two clips over a specified number of iterations.
     * Notes that only exist in one clip are faded in/out using velocity
     * Where several notes of the same pitch exist, if the number of notes do not match the target clip, any extraneous notes are faded in/out using velocity.
     * Notes that exist in both clips, i.e. share pitch but not position, are interpolated over the course of the specified number of durations.
