# `m4l-utate`

`m4l-utate` is a swiss army knife for offline processing of MIDI clips in Ableton Live. It can be used for tasks like aligning the notes of one clip rhythmically with another, using one clip as a transpose track for another clip, recursively applying the contents of a clip on itself (fractalize!), and a ton of other uses. Below is a list of the functions I'd like to support for version 1.0:

&#10003; Constrain note start positions<br>
&#9675; Constrain note values<br>
&#9675; Fractalize clip<br>
&#9675; Transpose from clip<br>
&#9675; Retrigger from clip<br>
&#9675; Rescale<br>
&#9675; Create retrig/ratchet<br>
&#9675; Selection logic (even, every #, series from start, series from end, pitch values, pairs, invert flag)<br>

&#10003;=Implemented, &#9675;=Planned
